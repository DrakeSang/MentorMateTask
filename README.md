MentorMateTask

The algorithm i followed is:
First i print the top line.
Second i make for cycle who enters only 2 times.
On the first time i print only the first middle lines and on the second i print second middle lines.
ONn the first and secodn set of middle line there is dependency between the numbers.
And last i print the bottom line.
I used java for the task.
I hope you like it and i will be glad to become part of your intership.
I am highly motivated to learn,grow and to write good code.
Sincerely,
Emil Yordanov
